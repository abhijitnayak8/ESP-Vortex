GPUs were traditionally used to support video games but because
of their improved performance and energy efficiency on other
computation-heavy applications such as machine learning, they
have become an integral part of heterogeneous SoC designs. Our
goal is to integrate Vortex, an open-source general purpose GPU,
in ESP, an open-source SoC architecture. We plan to do so using

ESP third-party accelerator flow. We will then perform verifica-
tion tests in simulation to check integration, invoke Vortex to

run a simple application and check for bottlenecks in ESP that
inhibit the performance of Vortex.
